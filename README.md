## Mock-up 

There are a few tools for mock-ups. Paper prototypes (low-tech, but effective and cheap), Digital picture edition software (gimp / photoshop / etc.), or dedicated tools like moqups.com (I'm calling out moqups here in particular since it seems to strike the best balance between "easy-to-use" and "wants your money" -- the free teir isn't perfect, but it should be sufficient for our needs with a little "creative layout" to get around the page-limit)

In this space please either provide images (around 4) showing your prototypes, OR, a link to an online hosted mock-up tool like moqups.com

**[Add images/photos that show your paper prototype (around 4)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) along with a very brief caption:**

Mockup photos
![Homepage](/static/images/homepagemockup.PNG)

This is our stock application homepage. The application itself is leaning towards more of a *stock tips* direction instead of trading so there are social media elements.
This homepage describes the site for a new user and shows trending posts with tips that are getting a lot of traction and stocks that are on the rise.

![Profile Page](/static/images/profilepagemockup.png)

This is a basic user profile page. When users create an account they can customize this page in a variety of ways, they can then create posts and manage notification settings.
![Feed Page](/static/images/feedpagemockup.png)

This is the very low fidelity outline of what our feed page will look like. Each tip/post will have interaction options for other users in the community (like, comment etc). 
Further modifications will likely be made but this is low-fidelity stuff.

![Browse Stocks](/static/images/browsestocksmockup.png)

A website dedicated to stocks would be incomplete without a means to browse through them. Although we no longer plan to facilitate stock transactions, we have a page that displays stock information.
There will likely be different pages based on how you want the information displayed (graphs/lists) and different filter options depending on how things pan out with the stock API.

We have a few more pages but they are mostly just different variations depending on certain actions and so not necessarily a page on their own. Really tried to limit the detail on 
these because we kept going a little overboard, hopefully we didn't limit things too much!
