## Mock-up 

There are a few tools for mock-ups. Paper prototypes (low-tech, but effective and cheap), Digital picture edition software (gimp / photoshop / etc.), or dedicated tools like moqups.com (I'm calling out moqups here in particular since it seems to strike the best balance between "easy-to-use" and "wants your money" -- the free teir isn't perfect, but it should be sufficient for our needs with a little "creative layout" to get around the page-limit)

In this space please either provide images (around 4) showing your prototypes, OR, a link to an online hosted mock-up tool like moqups.com

**[Add images/photos that show your paper prototype (around 4)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10189356/how-to-add-screenshot-to-readmes-in-github-repository) along with a very brief caption:**

Mockup photos
![Homepage](/static/images/frontpage.jpg)

This is our stock application homepage. The application itself is leaning towards more of a *stock tips* direction instead of trading so there are social media elements. The homepage shows top stock gains (with a related user post), stock losses (with a related user post), and trending posts from the users on the app. There are two main buttons, one for a profile dropdown and the other for more site navigation
![Profile Page](/static/images/signup.JPG)
This is the user signup page and user profile page, what the user can customize is still under discussion as we continue to design our tables.

![Feed Page](/static/images/userfeed.JPG)

This is a basic user feed page. It is focused solely on the people that the user follows with some other information not yet decided upon. There is also the option to create a post from the top right button. There are interaction buttons for like, repost and comment.

![Browse Stocks](/static/images/stockview.JPG)

A website dedicated to stocks would be incomplete without a means to browse through them. Although we no longer plan to facilitate stock transactions, we have a page that displays stock information. This information is going to be embedded in the webpage from an existing stock API
